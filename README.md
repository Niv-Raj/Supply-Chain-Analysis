# Supply Chain Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the supply chain data for a Fashion and Beauty startup. The dataset includes information related to the operations of makeup products, with a focus on sales, shipping, manufacturing, and supply chain logistics. The goal is to explore key relationships, derive actionable insights, and suggest improvements in various areas of the supply chain.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains features related to product sales, manufacturing processes, shipping details, and supplier information. The data is crucial for identifying inefficiencies and making data-driven decisions to optimize supply chain operations.

## Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Checked for missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
   - Analyzed basic statistics and distributions for numerical variables.
   - Investigated relationships between product-related variables and their categories.

2. **Statistical Testing:**
   - Applied statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis test) to identify significant relationships between variables.
   - Focused on combinations that showed statistically significant p-values (p-value < 0.05).

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created bar plots to visualize key metrics, comparing them across various categories.
   - Used contingency tables to analyze categorical variable pairings and better understand the relationships.

4. **Actionable Insights:**
   - Derived insights to optimize supply chain processes, including product sales, shipping strategies, and manufacturing improvements.

## Future Work

- Expand the analysis with machine learning models to predict outcomes based on identified relationships.
- Incorporate additional data for further validation and refinement of the insights.
